**Tool**: Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)

#### ✅ 10 Research Questions Investigated

1. **Global Temperature & CO2 Trends** - How have global average temperatures and CO2 emissions per capita trended over the years?
2. **CO2 vs Renewable Energy** - What is the relationship between a country's CO2 emissions per capita and its percentage of renewable energy usage?
3. **Forest Area & Rainfall** - Which countries have shown the most significant increase in forest area percentage, and how has this correlated with their average rainfall?
4. **Sea Level & Temperature** - Is there a correlation between the rise in sea level and the increase in average annual temperature?
5. **Weather Events vs Energy Policy** - How does the frequency of extreme weather events vary between countries with high renewable energy adoption versus those with low adoption?
6. **Population vs CO2 Growth** - What is the trend in population growth compared to the trend in CO2 emissions for the top 10 most populous countries?
7. **High Renewable + High CO2 Outliers** - Which countries are outliers in terms of having high renewable energy usage but still high CO2 emissions per capita?
8. **Deforestation & Rainfall** - How has average annual rainfall changed over time for countries that have experienced significant deforestation?
9. **Multivariate Analysis** - What is the multivariate relationship between population, CO2 emissions, and average temperature?
10. **Success Stories** - Identify countries that have successfully reduced their emissions growth and analyze their corresponding data on renewable energy and forest area.

### Instruction Set 2: Strategic Insights & Policy Recommendations  

**Role**: Data Consultant for Policymakers

#### 🎯 7 Key Strategic Insights

1. **Forest Conservation Drives Climate Resilience** - Countries like Japan (+36.3%), Indonesia (+33.2%), and Argentina (+28.8%) show massive forest area increases correlating with climate stability
2. **Renewable Energy Paradox** - 55 countries show high renewable energy (44.7% average) but still high CO2 emissions (17.7 tons/capita average)
3. **Population-Emission Decoupling** - USA shows 372% population growth with only -1.7% CO2 growth; Brazil shows sustainable development patterns
4. **Weather Events Show No Renewable Benefit** - No statistical difference in extreme weather between high/low renewable countries (p=0.678)
5. **System Complexity** - Weak correlations (r<0.012) between population, CO2, and temperature indicate complex system dynamics
6. **Deforestation-Rainfall Volatility** - Countries with >32% forest loss show rainfall declining trends (-5.3mm/year)
7. **Temperature-Sea Level Correlation** - Positive correlation (r=0.059) with synchronized upward trends over 23 years

#### 🏛️ 5 Policy Recommendations

1. **Mandatory Forest-First Climate Strategy** - 30% forest coverage targets, $50B annual fund
2. **Industrial Decarbonization Mandates** - 50% emission reduction for heavy industry by 2028
3. **Sustainable Development Technology Transfer** - Global clean technology access program
4. **Integrated Climate Resilience Infrastructure** - Climate-resilient standards for all new construction
5. **Systems-Based Climate Governance** - Multi-variable impact assessments for all policies
